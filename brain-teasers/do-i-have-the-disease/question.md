Let's say there is a disease that affects, on average, 2% of people.  There is a test for this disease.

- If someone who *has the disease* takes the test, the test will be positive 95% of the time.
- If someone who *does not have the disease* takes the test, the test will be positive 10% of the time.

You just took the test and it was positive.  What's the chance you have the disease?
