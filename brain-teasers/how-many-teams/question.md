N kids are going to play a game.  You need to split the kids up into teams.  How many ways can you do it?

A few clarifications:

- The teams to not have to be of equal size
- There can be any number of teams
- The teams do not have names and they are not unique in any way.  For
  example, if there were 4 kids named A, B, C, and D, putting A and B
  on the first team and C and D on the second team is no different
  than C and D on the first team and A and B on the second.
