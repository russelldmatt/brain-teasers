You have 3000 apples in Town A, and you want to transport them to Town B.  The towns are 1000 miles apart.  You have a truck you can use, but it has a hole in it, and an apple falls out of it each mile you drive.  The truck can only hold 1000 apples.  How many apples can you get to Town B from Town A?
