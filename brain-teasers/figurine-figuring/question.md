Jane received 78 figurines as gifts this holiday season: 12 drummers
drumming, 11 pipers piping, 10 lords a-leaping, etc., down to 1
partridge in a pear tree. They are all mixed together in a big
bag. She agrees with her friend Alex that this seems like too many
figurines for one person to have, so she decides to give some of her
figurines to Alex. Jane will uniformly randomly pull figurines out of
the bag one at a time until she pulls out the partridge in a pear
tree, and will give Alex all of the figurines she pulled out of the
bag (except the partridge, that’s Jane’s favorite).

If n is the maximum number of any one type of ornament that Alex gets,
what is the expected value of n, to seven significant figures?
