The traditional Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the rest
of the terms are produced by a rule, which says that every term is
equal to the sum of the previous two terms.  You can produce other
sequences by starting with different numbers but keeping the same
rule.  For example, you could start with 1 and 3, and produce this
sequence:

1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, ...

Can you come up with two starting numbers that make the resulting
sequence converge to zero?

Caveats/Additional info:
- You can't use (0, 0) as the two starting numbers!
- You're allowed to use non-integer values.
