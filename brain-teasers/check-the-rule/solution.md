The D and the 8.

- The D needs to be checked because if there is not a 3 on the other side, the rule is broken.
- The A does not need to be checked because no matter what is on the other side, the rule is fine.  The rule only dictates what is on the other side of a D.
- The 3 does not need to be checked.  If it's a D, then great - the rule is followed.  If it's not a D, that's fine too.
- The 8 needs to be checked.  If it's not a D on the other side, that's fine.  If it is a D on the other side, then the rule has been broken.
