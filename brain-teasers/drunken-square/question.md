Drunk Homer stumbles out of his house at the top right of the grid.  For some reason, he can only walk along the lines, X’s are off-limits.  At each vertex he picks another direction to walk at random.

He continues walking for a very long time.  He finally stops at random, what is the probability that he ends up at Moe’s?
