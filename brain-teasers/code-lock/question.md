A code has 4 digits and you know this information.

- 9285: one number is correct but in the wrong place
- 1937: two numbers are correct but in the wrong place
- 5201: one number is correct and in the right place
- 6507: nothing is correct
- 8524: two numbers are correct but in the wrong places

Can you crack the code?
