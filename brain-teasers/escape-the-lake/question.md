Imagine you are sitting in a rowing boat in the middle of circular
lake. Standing on the edge of the lake is a hungry monster. The
monster wants to eat you. You want to escape.

You know that, if you can reach land, you can outrun the monster, but
first of all, you need to row to shore. Here’s the issue: whilst you
can outrun the monster on foot, he can run faster than you can row the
boat. Much faster. The monster can run four times faster than you can
row. He’s also a clever monster and will always do that smartest thing
to attempt to catch you; moving around the shoreline, as needed, to
maximize his advantage. If he touches you, you’re dead!

Can you escape?
