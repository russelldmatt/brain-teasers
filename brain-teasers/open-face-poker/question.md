A standard 52 card deck is laid out face up.

1.  Player A picks 5 cards.
2.  Player B picks 5 cards.
3.  Player A may discard up to 5 cards and pick that many new face up cards.
4.  Player B may do the same.
5.  Player with higher poker hand wins.

Would you rather be player A, or player B, or does it not matter?
