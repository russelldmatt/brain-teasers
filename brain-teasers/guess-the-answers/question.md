I have 100 yes or no questions written down, along with their answers.  I'm not going to show you the questions or answers, but you can submit to me a guess of the answer to each question (100 yes's or no's) and I'll tell you how many you got right.

You can submit a new list of 100 guesses as many times as you need.

What's the minumum number of submissions you need to figure out all the correct answers?
