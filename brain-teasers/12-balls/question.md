There are 12 balls that look identical, however one weighs slightly different than the rest.

How can you identify which ball weighs differently, and whether it's heavier or lighter than the rest, in 3 weighings?

Note: The scale is not digital; it's an old-school balance scale where the only three possible measurements are "left heaver", "right heaver", or "equal".
