A shouts that his hat is white.

If A and B's hats were black, then C would immediately call out white, knowing that there are only 2 black hats.  Given 59 seconds have passed, A knows that is not the case.

If A's hat was black, B knows that if his hat was also black, C would call out white, as stated above.  Given 59 seconds have passed and B hasn't done that, A's hat must not be black.
