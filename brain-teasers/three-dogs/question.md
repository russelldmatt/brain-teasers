I have three dogs: Fatch, Fetch and Fitch. Yesterday, I found a brown
12-inch stick for them to play with. I marked the top and bottom of
the stick and then threw it for Fatch. Fatch, a Dalmatian, bit it in a
random spot — leaving a mark — and returned it to me. In her honor, I
painted the stick black from the top to the bite and white from the
bottom to the bite.

I subsequently threw the stick for Fetch and then for Fitch, each of
whom retrieved the stick by biting a random spot. What is the
probability that Fetch and Fitch both bit the same color (i.e., both
black or both white)?
