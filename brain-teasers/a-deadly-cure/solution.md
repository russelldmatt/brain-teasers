Only 10 mice.

Each mouse will represent a digit in base 2. Take each bottle, convert the bottle number to binary, and give it to mouse n if the nth binary digit is a one.

For example, for bottle number 484, it's binary representation is: 0111100100.  So, starting from the right, you would not give this serum to mouse 1, 2, 4, 5, and 10 but you would for mouse 3, 6, 7, 8, 9.

At the end of 7 days, the living mice will be the 0's of the deadly curse and will uniquely identify the bottle.
