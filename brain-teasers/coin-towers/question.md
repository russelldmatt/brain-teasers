In each of six boxes $$B_1$$, $$B_2$$, $$B_3$$, $$B_4$$, $$B_5$$, $$B_6$$ there is initially one coin. There are two types of operation allowed:

**Type 1:** Choose a nonempty box $$B_j$$ with $$1 \leq j \leq 5$$. Remove one coin from $$B_j$$ and add two coins to $$B_{j+1}$$.

**Type 2:** Choose a nonempty box $$B_k$$ with $$1 \leq k \leq 4$$. Remove one coin from $$B_k$$ and exchange the contents of (possibly empty) boxes $$B_{k+1}$$ and $$B_{k+2}$$.

**Warm up problem:** Using only operations of Type 1, what's the most coins you can have in total across all 6 boxes?

**Main problem:** Using operations of either type, what's the most coins you can have in total across all 6 boxes?
