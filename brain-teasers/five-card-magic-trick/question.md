At a party last night, my friends Alice and Bob did a magic trick. Any
ideas how it worked?

Alice shuffled a pack of cards, and asked me to take five. I looked at
them. She put the rest of the pack down on the table. Alice asked for
my cards. She gave four of them to Bob (he was across the table), and
the fifth back to me. Bob looked at the four cards for a while. Then
Bob looked at me, and named the card I was holding. He was right. I'm
quite sure he couldn't have seen it (we weren't sitting by a mirror).

They did the trick again later to someone else. I watched for funny
business. Alice didn't say anything to Bob, so I don't think they have
a code. Also Alice is famously clumsy, so I doubt it was sleight of
hand.
