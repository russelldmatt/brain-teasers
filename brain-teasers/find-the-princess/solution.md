For the castle with 4 doors:

Label the doors 1-4 from left to right.  I will pick open the doors in the following order: 2, 3, 3, 2 - and I guarantee you I will find the princess!  So it will take me 4 nights.

For $$n$$ doors:

It will take me $$2 (n-2)$$ nights.

I will start at door 2 and then progress, in order, to $$n-1$$, and then I will open the exact same doors, but in reverse order (start at $$n-1$$ and work my way back down to 2).
