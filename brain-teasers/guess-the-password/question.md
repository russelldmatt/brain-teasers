I have a lock with a 10 digit password.  I forgot my password, but here's what I remember:

- The first digit, is the number of 0's that occur in the 10-digit password
- The second digit, is the number of 1's that occur in the 10-digit password
- The third digit, is the number of 2's that occur in the 10-digit password
- ... etc, up to the tenth digit, is the number of 9's that occur in the 10-digit password

Can you help me guess my passcode?
