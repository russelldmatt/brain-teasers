I'll admit, this is *not* a problem that I solved myself.  I did,
however, hear the optimal strategy and then worked out the probability
that the prisoners survive with that strategy (which still wasn't
trivial!).  

Given that fact, and (more imporantly) the fact that this is a famous,
well-documented, problem, I'm going to refer you to the [solution
written up very clearly on
wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem#Solution).

For those of you who quickly want to know whether you're right or
wrong, the prisoners can survive with a shockingly high chance of
$$ \approx 0.31 $$!

Another quick result, is that the answer is very close to:

$$
1 - (ln(100) - ln(50)) = 1 - ln(2) \approx 0.30685
$$
