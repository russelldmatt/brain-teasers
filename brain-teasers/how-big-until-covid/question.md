It's August 2022.  There's still a global pandemic, but COVID rates
are finally plummeting!  The latest data in San Francisco says that
the asymptomatic positivity rate is only 2%.  Let's assume that means
that if you picked a random person who is not showing any signs of
being sick, there is a 2% chance that they have COVID.

You want to plan a party, but you don't want COVID to be present at
your party.  How many (asymptomatic) people can you invite to your
party while still having less than a 50% chance that anyone at your
party has COVID?
