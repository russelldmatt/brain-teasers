## About ##

This site is a compilation of interesting mathematical brain teasers.

A few disclaimers:

- I try to give credit to the source of the brain teaser on the question page.  If you think I didn't give credit where credit is due, just email me and I'll fix it.

- Difficulty ratings are personal.  They reflect how hard I found the problem.  If I haven't solved the problem yet, it's obviously just a guess.

- If the question is "Solved", that doesn't necessarily mean I solved it by myself.  It just means that I've included a solution.

- I post code in some of the solutions.  It's generally terribly written code, but for one-off math problems, I'd rather not spend the time to clean it up.
