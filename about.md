## About ##

This site is A) a place to collect all the interesting brain teasers that I've heard over the years and B) a way to learn how to write a mostly static website (using jekyll, fwiw).

A few disclaimers:

- I try to give credit to the source of the brain teaser on the question page.  If you think I didn't give credit where credit is due, just email me and I'll fix it.

- Difficulty ratings are personal.  They reflect how hard I found the problem.  If I haven't solved the problem yet, it's obviously just a guess.

- If the question is "Solved", that doesn't necessarily mean I solved it by myself.  I've considered adding more columns to the main page such as "Has Solution", "I solved", "I solved, with hints", etc. but decided against it.  Anyways, you probably don't care very much whether I actually solved it or not.

- I post code in some of the solutions.  It's terribly written code!  Please don't think that's how I would write something that's actually important, or has to be maintained.  But, for one off math problems, I'd rather not spend the time to clean up code that works.
