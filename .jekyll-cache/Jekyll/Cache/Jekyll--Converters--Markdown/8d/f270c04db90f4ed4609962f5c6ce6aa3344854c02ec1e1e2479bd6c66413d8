I" 	<p>Drew Reiner and I solved this together.  I canâ€™t say that our method was particularly elegant, it was mostly just think about it for a long time and try lots of stuff.  For a more complete dissection of this problem, I suggest looking <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.com/blue/OddballProblem1.shtml">here</a>.</p>

<p>Number the 12 balls from 0 to 11.</p>
