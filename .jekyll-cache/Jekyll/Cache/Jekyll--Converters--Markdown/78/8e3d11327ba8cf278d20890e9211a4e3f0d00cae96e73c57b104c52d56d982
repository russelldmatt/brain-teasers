I"$<p>An urn contains 20 balls, of which 17 are red and 3 are green. You remove one at a time, uniformly at random, until you remove a ball of a different color than the first ball you removed. At that point, you replace that last ball (the one that was a different color), and start over with the remaining balls.</p>

<p>For example, you might remove red, red, green, then replace green, then remove red, red, red, green, replace green, remove green, green, red, replace red, etc.</p>

<p>What is the chance that the last ball removed is green?</p>
