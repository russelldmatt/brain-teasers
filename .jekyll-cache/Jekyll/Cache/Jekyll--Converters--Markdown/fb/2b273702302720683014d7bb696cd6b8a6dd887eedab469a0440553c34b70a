<p>In an early morning, three rivals get together on an open spot in a dark wood to compose a quarrel by means of guns. A kind of duel, but with three persons: A, B and C. The rules of the game are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They draw lots who may fire first, second and third.</li>
  <li>Next, they will continue firing at each other in this order until only a single person is alive.</li>
  <li>Every person decides himself at which person he fires.</li>
  <li>Everyone knows that A hits (kills) in 100% of all shots, B hits (kills) in 80% of all shots and C hits (kills) in 50% of all shots.</li>
  <li>Each person chooses his ideal strategy.</li>
  <li>No one is killed by a stray bullet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Who has the largest chance of surviving the truel, and how big is this chance?</p>
