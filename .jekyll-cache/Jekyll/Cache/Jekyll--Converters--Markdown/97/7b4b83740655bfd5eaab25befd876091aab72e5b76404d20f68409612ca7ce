I"–<p>There are 12 balls that look identical, however one weighs slightly different than the rest.</p>

<p>How can you identify which ball weighs differently, and whether itâ€™s heavier or lighter than the rest, in 3 weighings?</p>

<p>Note: The scale is not digital; itâ€™s an old-school balance scale where the only three possible measurements are â€œleft heaverâ€, â€œright heaverâ€, or â€œequalâ€.</p>
