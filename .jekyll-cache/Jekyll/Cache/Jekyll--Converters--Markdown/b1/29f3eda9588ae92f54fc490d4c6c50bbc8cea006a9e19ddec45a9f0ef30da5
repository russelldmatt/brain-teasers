I"		<p>Maybe even more surprisingly than last time, \(9 + \frac{1}{n}\) of
them, on average, can survive, and 9 will <em>still definitely</em> survive
(i.e. you can definitely save the same number as if there were only 2
hat colors).  So, “as a function of \(n\)” is a bit misleading since
the answer doesn’t actually depend on \(n\), but I didn’t want to give
away the answer.  How can this be?</p>

<p>Here’s the strategy:</p>

<p>Before the game begins, the prisoners agree on a value, between \(0\)
and \(n-1\), for each hat color.</p>

<p>Once the game begins, each prisoner computes the sum of the value of
all the hats in front of them mod \(n\).  Let’s call this number
\(S\).  So, for example, if there were 3 hat colors, red, white, and
blue, and we’ve assigned them values 0, 1 and 2, respectively, and I
see 3 red hats, 5 white hats, and 1 blue hat in front of me, the sum of
the hat values would be \(3(0) + 5(1) + 1(2) = 7\) and then that mod
\(n\) is \(S = 7 \% 3 = 1\).</p>

<p>The prisoner in the back of the line, who has to guess first, again
can’t do better than random, so his goal is to transfer as much
information to the people in front of him as possible.  So, what he
will do is convey his number \(S\) by guessing the hat color that has
the same value as (his) \(S\).</p>

<p>Then, for each prisoner from then on, they can compute their hat color
by subtracting the \(S\) of the person behind them with their \(S\)
(mod \(n\)).  For example, if \(n = 3\) and if the person behind me
has an \(S = 1\) and my \(S = 0\) then the value of my hat must be
\(1\).  If my \(S = 2\) then the value of my hat must be \(2\) (\((1 - 2) \% 3 = 2\)).  If my \(S = 1\) then the value of my hat must be \(0\).</p>

<p>So, it’s clear how the second the last person in line can correctly
compute his or her own hat color since they know the value of \(S\)
for the last person in line.  The third to last person in line will be
able to compute the \(S\) value for the second to last person in line
once that person (correctly) guesses their own hat color.  And so on
down the line.</p>

<p>Aside: If you think about the strategy when there were 2 hats, it was
actually the same as this strategy since you can think of computing
even and odd as the same as summing binary numbers, mod 2.</p>
