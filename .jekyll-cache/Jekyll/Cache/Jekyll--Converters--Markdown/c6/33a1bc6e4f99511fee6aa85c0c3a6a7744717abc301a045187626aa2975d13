I"F<p>More on this &lt;a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.</p>

<p>Let’s build up incrementally.  The first person has a birthday on some random day.  What’s the chance that the second person has the same birthday as the first?</p>

\[1 / 365\]

<p>Let’s say he doesn’t share the same birthday as the first (\(P = 1-1/365\)), what’s chance that the third person shares a birthday with one of the first two people?</p>

\[2/365\]

<p>To generalize, the chance that the (n+1)th person shares a birthday with first n people, assuming the first n people all have different birthdays, is</p>

\[n/365\]

<p>Now to flip it around, the probability that no one shares a birthday out of n people:</p>

\[(1-1/365) (1-2/365) (1-3/365)...(1-(n-1)/365) \\
\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} 1-i/365\]

<p>So the probability that at least one two people share a birthday out of n people:</p>

\[P = 1 - \prod_{i=1}^{n-1} 1-i/365\]

<p>Now, just find the smallest \(n\) s.t. \(P &gt; 0.5\).  For this, I just use a computer and find that when \(n = 23\), \(P \approx 0.507\).</p>
