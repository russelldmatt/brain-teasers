<p>A man is lost in a desert and comes upon a wall.  The wall has a miniature of a picture of the wall and an arrow pointing at the very middle saying “you are here”.  It also states that that, at some location, the wall is broken, opening up a passageway to a garden of fruit and water.</p>

<p>The man, hoping to survive, wants to minimize his time finding this hole in the wall.</p>

<p>What should the man’s strategy be if he assumes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The hole’s location is randomly distributed across the entire wall</li>
  <li>The hole’s location is distributed with a symmetrical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution">triangular distribution</a> with the peak probability at the center.</li>
</ol>
