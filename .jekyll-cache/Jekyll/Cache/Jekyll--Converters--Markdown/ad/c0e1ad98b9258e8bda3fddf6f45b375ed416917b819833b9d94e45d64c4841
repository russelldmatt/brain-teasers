<p>Treasure hunters have recovered a chest with unknown contents. The contents of the chest are worth something between $0 and $1000, with equal probability. The chest is going to be auctioned, and you are the only participant in the auction. The rules of the auction are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may place one bid for the chest</li>
  <li>If your bid is less than the actual value of the contents, you do not win the auction.</li>
  <li>If your bid is greater than the actual value of the contents, you pay your bid and receive the chest.</li>
  <li>If you win the chest, you can sell it to Mr X, who will pay 1.5 times the actual value of the chest.</li>
</ul>

<p>What is your optimal strategy for this auction?</p>
