<p>This site is a compilation of interesting mathematical brain teasers.</p>

<p>A few disclaimers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I try to give credit to the source of the brain teaser on the question page.  If you think I didn’t give credit where credit is due, just email me and I’ll fix it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Difficulty ratings are personal.  They reflect how hard I found the problem.  If I haven’t solved the problem yet, it’s obviously just a guess.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the question is “Solved”, that doesn’t necessarily mean I solved it by myself.  It just means that I’ve included a solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I post code in some of the solutions.  It’s generally terribly written code, but for one-off math problems, I’d rather not spend the time to clean it up.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
