I"a<p>7 races.</p>

<p>Races 1-5: Partition the horses into groups of 5 and race each group.  This takes 5 races in total.</p>

<p>After that, you know the relative ordering of the horses within each
group of 5.  Arrange each group from fastest to slowest, like so:</p>

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
	<img src="sol1.jpeg" style="width: 300px;" />
</div>

<p>We can now elimiate the slowest 2 horses in each group, since they could not possibly be in the fastest 3 horses overall.</p>

<p>Race 6:  Race the fastest horse in each group, like so:</p>

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
	<img src="sol2.jpeg" style="width: 300px;" />
</div>

<p>Without loss of generality, we can assume the fastest horse was in group #1, the second fastest was in group #2, etc.</p>

<p>We can now eliminate more horses:</p>

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
	<img src="sol3.jpeg" style="width: 300px;" />
</div>

<p>Race 7:  For the last race, race all the remaining horses except for the very fastest horse (which we alraedy know, since the winner of race 6 must be the fastest overall), like so:</p>

<div style="display:flex; justify-content: center;">
	<img src="sol4.jpeg" style="width: 300px;" />
</div>

<p>Picking the fastest two horse from race 7, along with the fastest horse overall, we can deduce the fastest 3 horses.</p>
