I"	<p>We can answer this question in two ways, first as a math problem (ignoring any real world considerations) and then as a real world question (i.e. how much would you <em>really</em> pay)?</p>

<h3 id="as-a-math-question">As a math question</h3>

<p>We donâ€™t know what distribution weâ€™re working with.  This is actually a huge hint, in the sense that we know weâ€™ll get the same answer for any distribution (otherwise, this question wouldnâ€™t have a single answer).  So an effective approach would be to just pick some distribution that makes the math easy and assume it will give the right answer, but weâ€™ll try to be more rigorous here.  So we will consider discrete and continuous distributions separately.</p>

<p>The discrete distribution is actually pretty easy.  There is some lowest number in the distribution, and there is some non-zero chance you pick it.  If you do, then I can <em>never</em> pick a lower number, meaning it will take me infinity picks and I will pay you infinity dollars.  Any non-zero probability of winning infinity dollars is still worth inifinity dollars.  So this is worth infinity in the discrete case.</p>

<p>The continuous case has the same answer, but itâ€™s less obvious.  The major insight is that we donâ€™t care what the probability distribution is, we only care about the CDF (cumulative distribution function).  A cumulative distribution function ranges from 0 to 1 and tells you the probability that you pick a number &lt;= x.  As an example, \(cdf(7) = 0.25\) means there is a 25% chance you pick a number less than 7.  Another property of the \(cdf\) is that it produces a number <em>uniformly</em> between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s say you pick a number \(x\) and \(cdf(x) = 0.2\).  How many tries, on average, will it take for me to pick a number lower than it?  If each pick I have a 20% chance of getting a number lower (by the definition of cdf), then it will take 5 tries, on average.  In general, if \(cdf(x) = y\) it will take me \(1/y\) tries to pick a lower number.</p>

<p>Now we just integrate.  Iâ€™m going to integrate over \(y\) (the \(cdf(x)\)), not \(x\) because I know that \(y\) is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, regardless of the distribution of \(x\).</p>

\[\int_{0}^{1} \frac{1}{y} dy = \infty\]

<p>Infinity dollars!  How could it be?  It really seems like this game is not worth infinity dollars.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a rough intuition why this integral does not converge.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is a 10% chance that the \(cdf(x)\) is &lt;= 0.1.  And if it is, the expected payout of the game is $10.  0.1 * $10 = 1.</li>
  <li>There is a 1% chance that the \(cdf(x)\) is &lt;= 0.01, and if it is, the expected payout of the game is $100.  0.01 * $100 = 1.</li>
  <li>There is a 0.1% chance that the \(cdf(x)\) is &lt;= 0.001, and if it is, the expected payout of the game is $1000.  0.001 * $1000 = 1.</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, because the payout increases as fast as the probability of that payout decreases, each term of this integral is a constant.  Taking the integral is like summing up a constant infinity times.  This is like a continuous analogue to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Petersburg_paradox">St. Petersburg Paradox</a></p>

<h3 id="how-much-would-you-really-pay-though">How much would you really pay, though?</h3>

<p>There are many ways to take realistic considerations into account, but Iâ€™ll pick a very simple one.</p>

<p>Assume that if the payout is more than $100,000 I wonâ€™t be able to pay you.  Iâ€™ll just pay you the minimum of $100,000 and whatever the number of rolls really was.  In that case:</p>

\[\int_{0}^{1} \min(100000, \frac{1}{y}) dy \approx 12.5\]

<p>So, $12.5 is a much more realistic price for this game.  Other real world considerations would probably take the price down even further.</p>
