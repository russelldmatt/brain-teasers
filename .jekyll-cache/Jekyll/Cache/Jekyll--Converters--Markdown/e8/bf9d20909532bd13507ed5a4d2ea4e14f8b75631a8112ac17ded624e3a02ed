I"+<p>This is a slighly modified version of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/pick-a-card-any-card/">this question</a> from the Riddler.</p>

<p>You will be given N numbers in sequence.  Each number is drawn from a uniform random distribution from 0 to 1.  After each number, you have the option to stop.  Your goal is to stop after receiving the highest number out of all N numbers.  If you do that, you win, otherwise, you lose.</p>

<p>What is the strategy that optimizes your chances of winning (and what is your probability of winning)?</p>
