I"¥<p>A shouts that his hat is white.</p>

<p>If A and Bâ€™s hats were black, then C would immediately call out white, knowing that there are only 2 black hats.  Given 59 seconds have passed, A knows that is not the case.</p>

<p>If Aâ€™s hat was black, B knows that if his hat was also black, C would call out white, as stated above.  Given 59 seconds have passed and B hasnâ€™t done that, Aâ€™s hat must not be black.</p>
