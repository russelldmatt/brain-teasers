I"=<p>~1.23 feet</p>

<p>Let’s call the width of the alley \(w\).  Cut \(w\) into two pieces at
the horizontal point at which ladders A and B meet.  Call the section
on the left, \(w_1\) and the section on the right \(w_2\).</p>

<p>Using similar triangles, we can set up the following equations:</p>

\[w_1 + w_2 = w \\
\frac{w}{\sqrt{4 - w^2}} = \frac{w_2}{1} \\
\frac{w}{\sqrt{9 - w^2}} = \frac{w_1}{1} \\\]

<p>So, we have 3 equations and 3 unknowns.  Should be able to solve it:</p>

\[\frac{w}{\sqrt{9 - w^2}} = w - w_2 \\
\frac{w}{\sqrt{9 - w^2}} = w - \frac{w}{\sqrt{4 - w^2}} \\
\frac{w}{\sqrt{9 - w^2}} + \frac{w}{\sqrt{4 - w^2}} = w \\
\frac{1}{\sqrt{9 - w^2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{4 - w^2}} = 1 \\\]

<p>I don’t know how to actually finish the solution all in closed form, but using a computer, ~1.23 is a solution.</p>
