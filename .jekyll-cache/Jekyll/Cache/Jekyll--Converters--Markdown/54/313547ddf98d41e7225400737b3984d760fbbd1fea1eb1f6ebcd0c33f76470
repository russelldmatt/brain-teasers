<p>Imagine that you have set of 13 dice.  The number of sides on each die corresponds to a prime number less than 42.  So, using the convention that ‚Äúdn‚Äù means a die with ‚Äún‚Äù sides (all with equal probability), your set of available dice are:</p>

<p>d2, d3, d5, d7, d11, d13, d17, d19, d23, d29, d31, d37, and d41</p>

<p>Your goal is to simulate the roll of a d42 using the set of avilable dice <em>in the least number of expected rolls</em>.</p>

<p>For example, your strategy could be as follows:</p>

<p>You can represent a number between 1 and 64 in binary using 6 bits.  Roll a d2 6 times to produce those 6 bits.  If your resuling binary number is &lt;= 42, then stop and treat that as the outcome of the d42.  Otherwise, repeat this process.</p>

<p>The expected number of rolls this would take is \(\frac{6}{42/64}\) which is a little over 9 rolls.</p>
