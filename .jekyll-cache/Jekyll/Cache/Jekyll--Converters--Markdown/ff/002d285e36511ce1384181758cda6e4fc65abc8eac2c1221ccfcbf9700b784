I"¤<p>Letâ€™s declare 6 variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>\(d0\) is the expected number of turns until all 6 switches are on when 0 switches are on</li>
  <li>\(d1\) is the expected number of turns until all 6 switches are on when 1 switch is on</li>
  <li>\(d2\) is the expected number of turns until all 6 switches are on when 2 switches are on</li>
  <li>\(d3\) is the expected number of turns until all 6 switches are on when 3 switches are on</li>
  <li>\(d4\) is the expected number of turns until all 6 switches are on when 4 switches are on</li>
  <li>\(d5\) is the expected number of turns until all 6 switches are on when 5 switches are on</li>
</ul>

<p>We can then construct the following system of equations:</p>

\[\begin{align*}
d0 &amp;= 1 + d1 \\
d1 &amp;= 1 + 1/6 \cdot d0 + 5/6 \cdot d2 \\
d2 &amp;= 1 + 2/6 \cdot d1 + 4/6 \cdot d3 \\
d3 &amp;= 1 + 3/6 \cdot d2 + 3/6 \cdot d4 \\
d4 &amp;= 1 + 4/6 \cdot d3 + 2/6 \cdot d5 \\
d5 &amp;= 1 + 5/6 \cdot d4 + 1/6 \cdot 0 \\
\end{align*}\]

<p>Since Iâ€™m lazy, I just asked python to solve them for me:</p>

<p>The answer we are looking for is \(d0\) which is 83.2.</p>
