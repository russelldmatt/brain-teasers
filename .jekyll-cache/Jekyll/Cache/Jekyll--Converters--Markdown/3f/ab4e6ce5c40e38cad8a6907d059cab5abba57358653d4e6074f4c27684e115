I"r<p>Pay nothing.  Think about the side pile.  Cards are put into it one pair of red and black cards at a time.  There will be the same number of red and black cards in that pile.  Therefore, there are an equal number of red and black cards leftover to be in you and my pile, respectively.  We will tie every time.  You only get the $100 if you win.  So, pay nothing.</p>
