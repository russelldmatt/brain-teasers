I"<p><a href="https://oeis.org/A281701">OEIS</a> for this sequence.  See the formula section for the exact answer.</p>

<p>I thought it was really interesting/counterintuitive that adding operations of the second type made such a massive difference to the number of coins you could make.  I didn’t find the exact optimal answer (or a formula for it), but I found a way to make enough coins such that even if the coins were pennies, I’d have all the money in the world.  Figured that was enough to stop.</p>

<p>This problem is related to the 5th problem on <a href="http://yisun.io/papers/imo2010.pdf">the 51st IMO</a> (see problem 5), which Terrence Tao blogged about <a href="https://polymathprojects.org/2010/07/08/minipolymath2-project-imo-2010-q5/">here</a>.</p>
