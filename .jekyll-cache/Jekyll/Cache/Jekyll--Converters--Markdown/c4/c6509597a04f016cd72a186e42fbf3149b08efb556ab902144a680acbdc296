I"=<p>Thinking about the path of the dog makes this problem hard.  Instead, think about the path of the people.  Combined, Bob and Sam are closing the 2 mile gap between them at a rate of 10 MPH.  So that takes 1/5 of an hour.</p>

<p>The dog runs at 25MPH, so how far can he run in 1/5 of an hour?  Easy, 5 miles.</p>
