<p>A pirate ship captures a treasure of 1000 golden coins.  The treasure is to be split among the pirates: 1,2,3,4, and 5 in order of rank.  The pirates have the following important characteristics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Infinitely Smart</li>
  <li>Greedy</li>
  <li>Bloodthirsty</li>
</ul>

<p>Starting with pirate 5 they can make a proposal how to split up the treasure.  This proposal can either be accepted or the pirate is thrown overboard.  A proposal is accepted if and only if a majority of the pirates agree on it.</p>

<p>What proposal should pirate 5 make?</p>
