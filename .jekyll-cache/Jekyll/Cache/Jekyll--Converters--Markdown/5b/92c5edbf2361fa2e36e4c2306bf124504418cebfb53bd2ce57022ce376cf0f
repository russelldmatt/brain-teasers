I"¦<p>Then answer is \(\frac{1}{3}\).</p>

<p>Jane has two children.  From this, we start with four, equally likely,
possibilities: BB BG GB GG.</p>

<p>Jane has at least one son.  So we now know that only three of the four
possibilites satifsy this condition: BB, BG, GB.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s the chance that she has two sons?  Jane only has two boys in
one of the three (equally likely) possibilities, so \(\frac{1}{3}\).</p>
