<p>Unsurprisingly, this question involves a perverse jailer and two prisoners hoping to gain their freedom.</p>

<p>The jailer has devised the following game:</p>

<p>Prisoner #1 will enter into a room, where he will find a standard 8x8 chess-board and the jailer.  On each square, there will be a quarter.  The jailer will point to a square of his choosing, then Prisoner #1 will be forced to flip over a single quarter, but he can choose which quarter to flip.</p>

<p>Next, prisoner #2 will enter the same room.  He gets the opportunity to point to a single square.  If he points to the same square that the jailer pointed to, both prisoners survive.  Otherwiseâ€¦ you know the drill.</p>

<p>Prisoner #1 and #2 can collaborate before the game begins, but once the game starts they are no longer allowed to communicate in any way.</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s the best strategy?  How likely are they to survive?</p>
