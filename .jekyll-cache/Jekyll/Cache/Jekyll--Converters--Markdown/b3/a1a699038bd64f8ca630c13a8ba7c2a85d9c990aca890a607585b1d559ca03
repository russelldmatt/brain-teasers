<p>Drunk Homer stumbles out of his house at the top right of the grid.  For some reason, he can only walk along the lines, Xâ€™s are off-limits.  At each vertex he picks another direction to walk at random.</p>

<p>He continues walking for a very long time.  He finally stops at random, what is the probability that he ends up at Moeâ€™s?</p>
