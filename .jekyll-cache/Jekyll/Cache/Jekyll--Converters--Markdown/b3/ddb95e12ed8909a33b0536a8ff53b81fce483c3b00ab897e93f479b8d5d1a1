<p>We are going to play a card game.  I will shuffle a standard deck of 52 cards and then flip over two cards at a time.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the two cards are red, you get them in your pile.</li>
  <li>If the two cards are black, I get them in my pile.</li>
  <li>If the cards are one red and one black, we will put them into a side pile.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once I am through the entire deck, you count your pile and I will count mine.  If you have more cards in your pile than I have in mine, I will pay you $100.</p>

<p>What is the most that you would pay to play this game?</p>
