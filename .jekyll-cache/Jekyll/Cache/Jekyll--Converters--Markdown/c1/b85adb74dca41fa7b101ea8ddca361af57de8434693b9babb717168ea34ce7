I"Z	<p>This is a fairly straightforward application of bayes theorom.  To make things easier, let’s define a few symbols:</p>

<p>\(o\) = bathroom is occupied <br />
\(v\) = bathroom is vacant <br />
\(\bar{o}\) = bathroom sign says occupied <br />
\(\bar{v}\) = bathroom sign says vacant <br /></p>

<p>With this new terminology, let’s go through the question again:</p>

<p>Assume that 1/3 of bathroom users don’t notice the sign upon entering or exiting. Therefore, whatever the sign reads before their visit, it still reads the same thing during and after their visit. Another 1/3 of the users notice the sign upon entering and make sure that it says “Occupied” as they enter. However, they forget to slide it to “Vacant” when they exit. The remaining 1/3 of the users are very conscientious: They make sure the sign reads “Occupied” when they enter, and then they slide it to “Vacant” when they exit.</p>

\[P[\bar{o}|o] = \frac{1}{3}P[\bar{o}|v] + \frac{2}{3}(1) \\
P[\bar{o}|v] = \frac{1}{3}P[\bar{o}|v] + \frac{1}{3}(1) + \frac{1}{3}(0) \\
\frac{2}{3}P[\bar{o}|v] = \frac{1}{3} \\
P[\bar{o}|v] = \frac{1}{2} \\
\therefore P[\bar{v}|v] = \frac{1}{2} \\
\therefore P[\bar{o}|o] = \frac{1}{3}\frac{1}{2} + \frac{2}{3}(1) = \frac{5}{6} \\\]

<p>Finally, assume that the bathroom is occupied exactly half of the time, all day, every day.</p>

\[P[o] = 1/2 \\
P[v] = 1/2 \\\]

<p>Two questions about this workplace situation:</p>

<p>If you go to the bathroom and see that the sign on the door reads “Occupied,” what is the probability that the bathroom is actually occupied?</p>

\[P[o|\bar{o}]?\]

<p>Apply bayes theorem:</p>

\[P[o|\bar{o}] = \frac{P[\bar{o}|o] P[o]}{P[\bar{o}]}\]

<p>We know everything except \(P[\bar{o}]\) but that’s easy to solve for:</p>

\[P[\bar{o}] = P[\bar{o}|o]P[o] + P[\bar{o}|v]P[v]  = \frac{5}{6}\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{3}\]

<p>So, plugging everything in:</p>

\[P[o|\bar{o}] = \frac{P[\bar{o}|o] P[o]}{P[\bar{o}]} \\
P[o|\bar{o}] = \frac{\frac{5}{6} \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{5}{8}\\\]

<p>If the sign reads “Vacant,” what is the probability that the bathroom actually is vacant?</p>

\[P[v|\bar{v}] = \frac{P[\bar{v}|v]P[v]}{P[\bar{v}]} \\
P[\bar{v}] = \frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{6}\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{3} \\
P[v|\bar{v}] = \frac{\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{3}} = \frac{3}{4} \\\]
