I"·<p>You have n coins in a row in some beginning state of heads/tails. Define a process as follows:</p>

<p>If you have k&gt;0 heads, flip over the coin in the kth position from the left.
If you have k=0 heads, stop. Otherwise repeat.</p>

<p>For example, for THT, the process goes
THT -&gt; HHT -&gt; HTT -&gt; TTT</p>

<p>For fixed n, calculate the average number of steps it takes to
terminate over all 2^n possible beginning states.</p>
