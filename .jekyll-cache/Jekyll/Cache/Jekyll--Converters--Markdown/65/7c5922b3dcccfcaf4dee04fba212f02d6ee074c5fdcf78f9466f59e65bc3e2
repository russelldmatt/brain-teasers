I"×<p>Break the problem up into mutually exclusive outcomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Warriors win in 4 games</li>
  <li>Warriors win in 5 games</li>
  <li>Warriors win in 6 games</li>
  <li>Warriors win in 7 games</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatâ€™s the probability that Warriors win in 4 games?  Thatâ€™s easy, itâ€™s just \(0.6^4\).</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s the probability that Warriors win in 5 games?  Any given 5 game streak, such as WWLWW is equally probable, with \(P = 0.6^4 0.4^1\).  How many streaks are there?  The one loss can be anywhere in the first 4 games, so 4.  But more generally, \({4 \choose 1} = 4\).  So the probability that the warriors win in 5 games is \({4 \choose 1} 0.6^4 0.6^1\).</p>

<p>Whatâ€™s the probability that Warriors win in 6 games?  Similar to above, the two losses can come in any of the first 5 games, and each 6-game winning streak is equally likely: \({5 \choose 2} 0.6^4 0.4^2\).</p>

<p>You might detect a pattern, but thereâ€™s only one last case: \({6 \choose 3} 0.6^4 0.6^3\).</p>

<p>Putting it all together, letâ€™s call \(L\) the number of losses and \(T\) the total number of games:</p>

\[T = L + 4 \\
\sum_{L=0}^{3} {T - 1 \choose L} 0.6^4 0.4^L \\
\sum_{L=0}^{3} {L + 3 \choose L} 0.6^4 0.4^L \\
\approx 0.71\]
