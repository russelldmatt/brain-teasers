I"²<p>Only 7 weights!</p>

\[w_0 = 1 \\
w_n = 2 \sum_{x=0}^{n-1} w_x + 1\]

<p>If you proceed in this way, youâ€™ll be able to make every weight up to the sum of all weights youâ€™ve taken so far.</p>

<p>Starting with only 1, the highest weight you can make is 1, so you should take 3 next (1 * 2 + 1).</p>

<p>As the problem stated, with 1 and 3, you and make 1 to 4.  Using my formula, the next weight to take is 9 (2 * 4 + 1).</p>

<p>Without using the 9, you can already make 1 to 4.  That means you can subtract any of 1-4 from 9, and therefore will be able to make 5-8.  You can also add 1-4 to 9, and now will be able to make 10-13.  Now that you can make up to 13, you should take 27 (2 * 13 + 1).</p>

<p>Using the same logic as before, you can now make any weight up to 40.  So take 81.</p>

<p>And so onâ€¦</p>

<ul>
  <li>1 â€“&gt; gets you up to 1</li>
  <li>3 â€“&gt; gets you up to 4</li>
  <li>9 â€“&gt; gets you up to 13</li>
  <li>27 â€“&gt; gets you up to 40</li>
  <li>81 â€“&gt; gets you up to 121</li>
  <li>243 â€“&gt; gets you up to 364</li>
  <li>729 â€“&gt; gets you up to 1093</li>
</ul>

<p>Cool - powers of three.  My recursive formula just boils down to \(w_n = 3^n\).</p>
