I"_<p>The trick here is to understand that completion times do not add, but
rates do.  For example:</p>

<p>If Alice finishes a job in 2 hours and Bob finishes it in 3 hours,
when working together they <em>do not</em> finish it in 5 hours (2+3).  But
if Alice finishes 1/2 the job per hour and Bob finishes 1/3 of it per
hour, when working together they <em>do</em> finish 5/6 of it per hour (1/2 +
1/3)..</p>

<p>So now we can set up equations.  Let’s call \(A\) Alice’s per hour
rate, \(B\) Bob’s per hour rate, and \(C\) Charlie’s per hour rate.</p>

\[\begin{align*}
A + B &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \\
A + C &amp;= \frac{1}{3} \\
B + C &amp;= \frac{1}{4} \\
\end{align*}\]

<p>What is \(A + B + C\)?</p>

<p>Now it seems pretty simple, you add all three equations and divide by two:</p>

\[\begin{align*}
2A + 2B + 2C &amp;= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} \\
A + B + C &amp;= \frac{13}{24} \\
\end{align*}\]

<p>So, when all three work together, their per hour rate (\(A + B + C\)) is \(\frac{13}{24}\), so the time it takes them to complete the job is just 1 over the rate, so \(\frac{24}{13}\) hours.</p>
