I"â<p>For the castle with 4 doors:</p>

<p>Label the doors 1-4 from left to right.  I will pick open the doors in the following order: 2, 3, 3, 2 - and I guarantee you I will find the princess!  So it will take me 4 nights.</p>

<p>For \(n\) doors:</p>

<p>It will take me \(2 (n-2)\) nights.</p>

<p>I will start at door 2 and then progress, in order, to \(n-1\), and then I will open the exact same doors, but in reverse order (start at \(n-1\) and work my way back down to 2).</p>
