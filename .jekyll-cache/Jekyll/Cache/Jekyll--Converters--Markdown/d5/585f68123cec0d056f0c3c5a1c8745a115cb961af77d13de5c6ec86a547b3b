I"<p>I have a lock with a 10 digit password.  I forgot my password, but here’s what I remember:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first digit, is the number of 0’s that occur in the 10-digit password</li>
  <li>The second digit, is the number of 1’s that occur in the 10-digit password</li>
  <li>The third digit, is the number of 2’s that occur in the 10-digit password</li>
  <li>… etc, up to the tenth digit, is the number of 9’s that occur in the 10-digit password</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you help me guess my passcode?</p>
