<p>A basketball player is in the gym practicing free throws. He makes his first shot, then misses his second. This player tends to get inside his own head a little bit, so this isnâ€™t good news. Specifically, the probability he hits any subsequent shot is equal to the overall percentage of shots that heâ€™s made thus far. (His neuroses are very exacting.) His coach, who knows his psychological tendency and saw the first two shots, leaves the gym and doesnâ€™t see the next 96 shots. The coach returns, and sees the player make shot No. 99. What is the probability, from the coachâ€™s point of view, that he makes shot No. 100?</p>
