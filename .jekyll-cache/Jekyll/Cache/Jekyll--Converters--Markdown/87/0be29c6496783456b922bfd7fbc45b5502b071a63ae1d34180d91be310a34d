I"<<p>It’s so simple (yet incredibly hard).  Pick a number, x, from a distribution that covers all real numbers (e.g. a normal distribution).  If the amount of money in your envelope is less than x, switch.  Otherwise don’t switch.</p>

<p>As long as there is some probability that x &gt; “amount in smaller envelope” and x &lt;= “amount in larger envelope” then there is some chance you decide to switch at exactly the right time.  Since the amounts in both envelopes aren’t the same, and a normal has positive probability for all x, then sampling from a normal distribution satisfies this constraint.</p>

<p>Slightly more rigorously, consider all cases:</p>

<ul>
  <li>x &lt;= both envelopes</li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t switch with either envelope.  P(you end up with larger envelope) = P(you were initially handed larger evelope) = 50%.</p>

<ul>
  <li>x &gt; both envelopes</li>
</ul>

<p>You switch with either envelope.  P(you end up with larger envelope) = P(you were initially handed smaller evelope) = 50%.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Else (x &gt; smaller envelope and x &lt;= larger envelope)</li>
</ul>

<p>You switch only with smaller envelope.  You end up with larger envelope 100% of the time.</p>

<p>So, as long as there is some probability you end up in the third case, the P(ending up with larger envelope) &gt; 50%.</p>
