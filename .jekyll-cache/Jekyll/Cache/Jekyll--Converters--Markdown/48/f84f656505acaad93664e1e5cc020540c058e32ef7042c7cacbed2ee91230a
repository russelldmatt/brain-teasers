I"¢<p>I love math.  There are so many ways to phrase <a href="https://oeis.org/A002415">the answer to this question</a>.  Here are a few.</p>

\[\begin{align*}

f(n) &amp;= \frac{n^2(n^2-1)}{12} \\

f(n) &amp;= \sum_{i=0}^{n} \sum_{j=0}^{i} j^2 \\

g(n) &amp;= n \\
h(n) &amp;= n^2 \\
f(n) &amp;= g * h \\
\end{align*}\]

<p>where \(*\) in the last formula represents the convolution operator.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t have enough time right now to fully explain the following diagram, but hereâ€™s something in the way of a solution that most closely resembled the last formula (the convolution of the natural numbers and the square numbers).</p>
