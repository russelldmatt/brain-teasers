<p>N kids are going to play a game.  You need to split the kids up into teams.  How many ways can you do it?</p>

<p>A few clarifications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The teams to not have to be of equal size</li>
  <li>There can be any number of teams</li>
  <li>The teams do not have names and they are not unique in any way.  For
example, if there were 4 kids named A, B, C, and D, putting A and B
on the first team and C and D on the second team is no different
than C and D on the first team and A and B on the second.</li>
</ul>
