I"·<p>Let \(g(n,k)\) be the number of ways you can put n people into k buckets:</p>

\[g(n,k) = k^n\]

<p>Let \(f(n,k)\) be the number of ways you can put n people into k buckets, <em>using all k buckets</em>.</p>

\[f(n,k) = g(n,k) - \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}{ k \choose i }f(n,i)\]

<p>In words, the number of ways you can put n people into k buckets <em>using all k buckets</em>, is the number of ways you can put n people into k buckets, minus the number of ways you can put n people into exactly 1 bucket (times the number of ways you can choose that one bucket out of k buckets), minus the number of ways you can put n people into exactly 2 buckets (times the number of ways you can choose those two buckets out of k buckets), etcâ€¦</p>

<p>Now that we have \(g\) and \(f\), the original problem just becomes:</p>

<p>Find the smallest \(N\), s.t. \(f(N, 365) &gt; g(N, 365) / 2\).</p>

<p>Using a computer, I found the smallest \(N\) to be \(2287\).</p>
