<p>George, a particularly curious monkey, finds a typewriter and starts (randomly) typing at a rate of 1 letter/second.  George is 2 at the time.  Assuming he doesnâ€™t get any better at typing, what is Georgeâ€™s expected age before he types the word abracadabra?</p>

<p>P.S.  Assume typewriter has all 26 letters, lowercase only.</p>
