I"3<p>We’re going to play a game.  We have some distribution from which we can pick a number.</p>

<p>You’re going to pick a number first.  I’m then going to pick a number until I get a lower number than yours, paying you $1 for every number I pick.</p>

<p>How much would you pay to play this game?</p>
