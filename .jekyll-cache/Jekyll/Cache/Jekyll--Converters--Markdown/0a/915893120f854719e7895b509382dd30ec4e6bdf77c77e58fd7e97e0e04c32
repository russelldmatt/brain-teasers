I"<p>I’ll admit, this is <em>not</em> a problem that I solved myself.  I did,
however, hear the optimal strategy and then worked out the probability
that the prisoners survive with that strategy (which still wasn’t
trivial!).</p>

<p>Given that fact, and (more imporantly) the fact that this is a famous,
well-documented, problem, I’m going to refer you to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem#Solution">solution
written up very clearly on
wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>For those of you who quickly want to know whether you’re right or
wrong, the prisoners can survive with a shockingly high chance of
\(\approx 0.31\)!</p>

<p>Another quick result, is that the answer is very close to:</p>

\[1 - (ln(100) - ln(50)) = 1 - ln(2) \approx 0.30685\]
