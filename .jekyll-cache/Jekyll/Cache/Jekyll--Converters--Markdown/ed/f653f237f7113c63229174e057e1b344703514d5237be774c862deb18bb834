I"<p>In each of six boxes \(B_1\), \(B_2\), \(B_3\), \(B_4\), \(B_5\), \(B_6\) there is initially one coin. There are two types of operation allowed:</p>

<p><strong>Type 1:</strong> Choose a nonempty box \(B_j\) with \(1 \leq j \leq 5\). Remove one coin from \(B_j\) and add two coins to \(B_{j+1}\).</p>

<p><strong>Type 2:</strong> Choose a nonempty box \(B_k\) with \(1 \leq k \leq 4\). Remove one coin from \(B_k\) and exchange the contents of (possibly empty) boxes \(B_{k+1}\) and \(B_{k+2}\).</p>

<p><strong>Warm up problem:</strong> Using only operations of Type 1, whatâ€™s the most coins you can have in total across all 6 boxes?</p>

<p><strong>Main problem:</strong> Using operations of either type, whatâ€™s the most coins you can have in total across all 6 boxes?</p>
