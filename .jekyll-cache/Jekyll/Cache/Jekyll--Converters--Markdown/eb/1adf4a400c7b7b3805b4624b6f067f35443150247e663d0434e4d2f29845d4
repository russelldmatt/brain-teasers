I"î<p>This is a somewhat famous problem, known as Moserâ€™s circle problem:</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s Wolframâ€™s formulation:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Determine the number of pieces into which a circle is divided if n
points on its circumference are joined by chords with no three
internally concurrent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A less jargony version is:</p>

<p>Draw n points on the circumference of a circle.  Connect each pair of
points with a straight line segment.  What is the maximum number of
regions that the circle can be divided into as a function of n?</p>

<p>A few examples:</p>

<p>For n = 2, it has 2 regions,</p>

<line x1="450" y1="250" x2="50" y2="250.00000000000003" stroke="blue" stroke-width="1"></line></svg>

<p>and for n = 3, it has 4 regions.</p>

<line x1="450" y1="250" x2="249.99999999999997" y2="50" stroke="blue" stroke-width="1"></line>
<line x1="250" y1="450" x2="249.99999999999997" y2="50" stroke="blue" stroke-width="1"></line></svg>
